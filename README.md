In a world where diseases spread rapidly and ailments become more common, medicine has become an invaluable field of study. These days, most studies of medicinal synthesis are done in the chemistry lab, however, it is often a hassle to figure out how to synthesise some drugs. The tree structure has the target molecule at its root, which then branches into the various components at each step. A postorder traversal would give the order of reagents to be combined with each other to form the target molecule. Synthesis of existing compounds/molecules would still be useful to create new drugs based on old ones. In the future, it could even be used to train machine models to create new synthesis pathways for novel drugs.

#### Menu

![Menu](https://github.com/redblutac1/CSPATWO/blob/main/src/main/resources/readme/menu.png?raw=true)

Upon opening the app, you are greeted by this very welcoming, very intuitive, very visually appealing GUI. A JAR could not be made due to technical difficulties, but nonetheless, you have to admit that the interface is astoundingly breathtaking! Just look at that.

#### Example Compounds

Intrigued, you click on the first button.

You see a ComboBox, allowing you to browse through a whole list of molecules with complicated names. If you love organic chemistry, you may recognise some of these molecules as industrially useful! You marvel at the genius of this app. With just a few clicks, you can find out what your favourite drug is made of!

#### My Compounds

But if you happen to have an organic chemistry test in a few days, what shall you do?

![My Compounds](https://github.com/redblutac1/CSPATWO/blob/main/src/main/resources/readme/my.png?raw=true)

You go to the My Compounds tab and realise that you can add your own molecules with their respective synthetic pathways! You jump for joy. This app has covered all bases.

#### Explore Compounds 

But what awaits you is even better...

![Explore Compounds](https://github.com/redblutac1/CSPATWO/blob/main/src/main/resources/readme/explore.png?raw=true)

Organic chemistry is messy, and sometimes some reactants in some reactions can be synthesised from even more basic building blocks! Well, by clicking on those molecules and pressing Explore, you can easily see how these molecules are made, without having to scroll through a laundry list of molecules and their individual reaction pathways.
