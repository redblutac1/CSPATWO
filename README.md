In a world where diseases spread rapidly and ailments become more common, medicine has become an invaluable field of study. These days, most studies of medicinal synthesis are done in the chemistry lab, however, it is often a hassle to figure out how to synthesise some drugs. The tree structure has the target molecule at its root, which then branches into the various components at each step. A postorder traversal would give the order of reagents to be combined with each other to form the target molecule. Synthesis of existing compounds/molecules would still be useful to create new drugs based on old ones. In the future, it could even be used to train machine models to create new synthesis pathways for novel drugs.
